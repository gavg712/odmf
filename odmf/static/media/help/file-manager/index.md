# !fa-file File manager

The file manager file:/ is a simple tool to share files concerning the observatory. The site-admins
create meaningful directory structures and uses `.readme.md` files (can be created by clicking on the
right pane in the file manager) to explain the directory structure. 

The `.readme.md` files are designed with help:odmf-markdown. The project admins work further on the
directory structure. A number of files can be shown directly in the website. Getting data into ODMF
generally starts with uploading files in the filemanager, importing the data in to the structured database
can follow optionally (see help:import ).

Viewers are implemented for CSV, Excel, Word, PDF, Image-Files and a couple of special cases.
