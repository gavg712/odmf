enhance the appearance of the text. **But you don't need to care!**

Creating links
--------------------

 * `file:/template/` links to a file or folder on the server. Use this to link to manuals, thesis etc. ==> file:template 
 * `ds:370` links to a dataset ==> ds:370 
 * `site:18` links to a site ==> site:18
 * `job:1` links to a job ==> job:1
 * `help:import` links to a file /help/import (this one): help:import
 * `photo:1` links to a photo ==> photo:1
 * `![title](/picture/thumbnail/1)`inserts a small version of a photo ==> ![title](/picture/thumbnail/1)
 * `user:philipp` links to a user page ==> user:philipp
 * `[link name](http://uni-giessen.de)` links to another web site. ==> [link name](http://uni-giessen.de)
 * `[title](/map)` links to a location on this site ==> [title](/map)
 * Just write the link address - it will be converted automatically to a link, eg. https://uni-giessen.de
